# Harmony music app
This app uses APIs for [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/), [Musixmatch](https://developer.musixmatch.com/documentation), and [Ticketmaster](https://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/discovery-api/v2/) to provide an all-in-one music experience. The [Spotify Play Button](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/widgets/) allows us to play music. It also users [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) to add social functionality (see what others are searching for). 

## Try it out
Harmony is deployed [here](https://claudiact6.github.io/group-project-1). You will need a Spotify account to log in.
